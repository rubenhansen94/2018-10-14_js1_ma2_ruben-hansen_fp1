//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?

2. What is the constructor?

3. What does the return statement do?

4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

	The function will terminate as soon as it hits the return keyword, and will therefore never get to console.log('My name is Andy');, ever. The answer is: 'inside my function'.

5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.
