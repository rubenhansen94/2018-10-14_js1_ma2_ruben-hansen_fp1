//MODULE ASSIGNMENT 2 - LEVEL 1

1. What is a function literal?

	



2. What is the constructor?

	The constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an object created withing a class. -MDN
	Couldn't have said it any easier myself. However as everything in JavaScript is an object, I've heard throughout the week people refering to the "()" after a function name or keyword as the constructor, I believe.



3. What does the return statement do?

	The 'return' statement is an essential part of functions if you plan on returning 'something' form aa function.
	As soon as the function reaches a return statement, it will return what is to be returned and stop the function, any code inside the function below an executed return statement will never be executed.



4. What will be written to the console from this function:
		function myFunction(){
			  return console.log('inside my function');
			  console.log('My name is Andy');
		}
		myFunction();

	The function will terminate as soon as it hits the return keyword, and will therefore never get to console.log('My name is Andy');, ever. The answer is: 'inside my function'.



5. Briefly describe scope in JavaScript.

	Scope refers to where you define your variables.
	Defining your variables outside, or with out the keyword 'var', the variable will be in the global (browser/window) scope.
	Defining your variable inside a function, with the keyword 'var', will make it a function/local scope variable only accessable from within that funciton, or further nested functions.
